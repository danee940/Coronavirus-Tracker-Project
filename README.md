# Coronavirus-Tracker-Project
Short coronavirus tracker made with Spring, which showd the total cases and daily new cases globally and per country.

This is my first project, making it while studying in uni. A good starting project to kind of see a product go from start to finish.

I used Java Spring, Thymeleaf and Bootsrap. 
All the data that was processed is from this source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv

Shotout to Java Brains for the tutorial provided.
